# Coding is poetry

- Writing code is fun
- Technology is how you get to the solution, it is not THE solution
- Only write code if you absolutely have to
- Comments are mostly evil
- Always know what your code is supposed to do before you start writing it
- Learn something new every day
- Always strive to simplify

- Coding is the best antidepressant (by Mari)
- Read books about programming, live a life that will let others to write a book about feelings. (by Mari)
